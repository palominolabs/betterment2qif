== Generating a key for signing Chrome extensions ==
openssl genrsa 1024 > chrome_private_key.pem

== Running tests ==
The easiest way to run the tests is by running
    bundle exec guard.
They will be re-run whenever files are changed. On my machine the colorizing doesn't work right so I have to do
this to strip the incorrect control characters:
    bundle exec guard | sed -e 's/3\[[^m]\{1,\}m//g'
